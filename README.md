# Utah State University AppLied (USUAL) Watershed Tools

## Overview
The Utah State University AppLied (USUAL) Watershed Toolkit is an ArcGIS Pro toolkit that automates the delineation of watersheds, sub-catchments, river-adjacent interfluves, and discretized river networks with the topological structure and feature attributes necessary for one-dimensional source-to-sink transport modeling in watersheds.

### Known Issues

ArcGIS does not always allows for tables to be overwritten. Temporary solution: In this case delete the temp folder for the respective tool you are running and try rerunning. 

Filenames with spaces can cause issues. I am working on incorporating a fix for this, however for the moment it is recommended that file names and paths does not contain spaces.
